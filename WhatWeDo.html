     "What is a CFO?"
 
    More often than not, the question of "What does a CFO do and why do I need a CFO?" crops up in conversations with clients. 
    Perhaps the main reason why the answer is not apparent to business owners is because they have performed the duties of a CFO to some degree at one point in time or another. 
    Be it doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations of how much to pay for a business, or attempting to structure tax effective transactions or corporate structures, or instituting some forms of internal controls and reporting structures in the organisation.
 
    In all these areas and more, an experienced CFO could provide his professional expertise, advice and judgment based on his skillsets and experiences.
    He functions as essentially the knowledge domain expert to go to for finance related issues in an organisation, working in tandem with accounting staff, providing leadership and direction.
 
    Having an experienced finance professional on board an organisation is not a luxury, it is a necessity if an organisation desires to thrive and grow in a constantly changing business environment.
    Traditionally, in the past, SMEs and start-ups would put off having such a person on their management team until they feel that revenues are on track or when there is a need to raise capital from investors. 
    However, with our virtual CFO model, SMEs and start-ups could avail themselves of our services, without the need to commit to and maintain a full-time CFO headcount.
